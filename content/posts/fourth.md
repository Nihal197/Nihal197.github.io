## Preface 

While working in the ever fast changing world of tech, first thing a begineer in Data science will come to face is data and it's specialized "requirements".
When I started, I had no idea how would one wrangle or play with the data. I was told to checkout Pandas cheatsheet (I will add a link soon), but when I was going through cheatsheets and the data I had in hand, I realised that this could be the trap for begineers to get trapped in.

What I want you to know is, it's great to start with a cheatsheet because the documentation itself might become overwhelming. But please, once you are comfortable with the cheatsheet syntaxes, take some time off and read the documentation. It is very beautifully designed and very beginner friendly with the tutorials. 

Let's say you want to start with Pandas, you know what a DataFrame is, what the most common syntaxes for it are, you can start reading documentation for DataFrame itself.
What this does is, it slowly builds a habit for you to read from documentation directly and not relying upon the video tutorials. I kid you not, when you'll come to the job you will have to catch up real fast and you might not be getting cheesy tutorials for each of the tools they are using. But, if you are comfortable with the documentation itself, you'll become unstoppable. 

There is next step to it, I personally do not recommend it but in case the need arises, you might have to look at the library itself to find what syntax does (won't be happing almost all the time).

## Pre-requisite 
There is none assumed except the reader's perseverance. 


## Overview 

Let's start with the big boy in python (Pandas). In this article I'll try to cover most of the stuff you'd have to know to ease your coding journey. From input to extraction, how to get comfortable and play with data, HOW TO VIEW THEM, what will be the syntaxes you must know, plotting  and in the end how to export it.
